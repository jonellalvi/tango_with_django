# to create mappings, use a tuple
# tuple MUST be called urlpatterns
# it contains a series of calls to the django.conf.url() function
# each call handles a unique mapping.
# only one URL mapping here.
# first parameter is ^$ which matches to an empty string.
# Any URL from the user matching this pattern means the view views.index()
# would be invoked by Django.
# the view would be passed a HttpRequest object as a parameter with
# information about the user's request to the server
# optional parameter to url() name, using 'index' as the value
